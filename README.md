Tippy is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Jasmyne Roberts

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Feature that calculates tip for a bill rounded to the nearest dollar
- [x] Background coloring and imagery

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

This is my very first time using Swift and Xcode, and as a result I encountered many connection-related bugs and errors that took hours to fix. I also had difficulty using the newly-changed default features in the main calculator page once that page loads.
